# üçëHolyAudio2D
Goal: To create a comprehensive and relatively simple to deploy 2D audio manager for the TeaPot TopHats dev team and for my own personal projects.

### Current Work: Added saving functionality for audio settings using binary files. It works for all MixerGroups but only works on one mixer, I need to add it so it works for multiples mixers. Need to add a pause for MixerGroup sounds?
