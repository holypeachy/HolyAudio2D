# 🍑HolyAudio2D
Goal: To create a comprehensive and relatively simple to deploy 2D audio manager for the TeaPot TopHats dev team and for my own personal projects.

---
### Recent Work: Added Pause and Unpause methods for sounds and sounds coming from specific MixerGroups. Made getters and setters for the UI.
### To Do: Create a LocalAudioManager for other entities. Clean up variable and method names for better readability. Make documentation.
