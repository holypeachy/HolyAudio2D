# üçëHolyAudio2D
Goal: To create a comprehensive and relatively simple to deploy 2D audio manager for the TeaPot TopHats dev team and for my own personal projects.

---
### Current Work: Added saving functionality for audio settings using binary files. It works for all Mixers and MixerGroups. Need to add a pause for MixerGroup sounds. Need to make getters for the UI.
