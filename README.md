# üçëHolyAudio2D
Goal: To create a comprehensive and simple-to-implement 2D Audio Manager for the Unity Engine to be used by the <a href="https://github.com/TeaPot-TopHats"><strong>TeaPot TopHats</strong></a> Dev Team, for my future projects, and for any amateur to use in their own projects.  

Notes: I'm almost done with the first version, some testing has been done.

Unity Editor Version: 2021.3.11f1 (This is the version of editor I used to make this. It will most likely work on later version although I have not tried)  
Latest Version: 0.1.0 (To Be Released)  
[Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NnbtP8w3GX-GcGULysWSbU4jnxgUk0piskP12fAMbic/edit?usp=sharing), this will be updated as the project progresses.

### Recent Work: 
- Added function to change looping of sounds
- Added methods to get length of clips.
- Editted docs for 0.1.0

### To Do: 
- Do more testing in a real project.
- Prep a package for release.

### Future Ideas:
- Add the ability to modify start and end times for the clip.
- Add a method that randomly plays a sound out of multiple sounds.
- Add "sound occlusion" and reverb.
