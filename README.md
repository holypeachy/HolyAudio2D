# üçëHolyAudio2D
Goal: To create a comprehensive and simple-to-implement 2D Audio Manager for the Unity Engine to be used by the <a href="https://github.com/TeaPot-TopHats"><strong>TeaPot TopHats</strong></a> Dev Team, for my future projects, and for any amateur to use in their own projects.  

Notes: Almost done with the first version, no testing has been done.

Unity Editor Version: 2021.3.11f1 (This is the version of editor I used to make this. It will most likely work on later version although I have not tried)  
Latest Version: 0.1.0 (To Be Released)
