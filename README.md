# üçëHolyAudio2D
Goal: To create a comprehensive and simple-to-implement 2D Audio Manager for the Unity Engine to be used by the <a href="https://github.com/TeaPot-TopHats"><strong>TeaPot TopHats</strong></a> Dev Team, for my future projects, and for any amateur to use in their own projects.  

Notes: I'm almost done with the first version, no testing has been done.

Unity Editor Version: 2021.3.11f1 (This is the version of editor I used to make this. It will most likely work on later version although I have not tried)  
Latest Version: 0.1.0 (To Be Released)

---
### Recent Work: 
- Added a method that allows a sound to be played even if the object is destroyed.
- 
### To Do: 
- Edit documentation.
- Do more testing in a real project.
- Prep a package for release.
- Organize Awake and/or Start code. 
- Add the capacity to loop sounds a certain amount of times.
- Make it so the PlayInPlace method can play both Sounds and SourceSounds, even by mistake.

### For Sean:
- Add function to change looping of sounds.
- Add method to get length of clip.
- Add get clip by name method.

### Future Ideas:
- Add the ability to modify start and end times for the clip.
- Add a method that randomly plays a sound out of multiple.
- Add "sound occlusion" and reverb.
