# 🍑HolyAudio2D
#### This was my first big solo and thorough project. I am especially proud of the [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NnbtP8w3GX-GcGULysWSbU4jnxgUk0piskP12fAMbic/edit?usp=sharing) (Yea very extensive. I'm a scientist, I've been brainwashed to love documenting everything I do xD). Around the time I finished it we weren't really working on game jam games and I was busy with school.
> Goal: To create a comprehensive and simple-to-implement 2D Audio Manager for the Unity Engine to be used by the <a href="https://github.com/TeaPot-TopHats"><strong>TeaPot TopHats</strong></a> Dev Team, for my future projects, and for any amateur to use in their own projects.  

### ⚠️ At this point I doubt I'll ever use this (much less continue working on it), I'm sure I could come up with a better design if I need to make something like it in the future.

Notes:
> The first "release" has been made.

> Unity Editor Version: 2021.3.11f1 (This is the version of editor I used to make this. It will most likely work on later version although I have not tried)  
> Latest Version: 0.1.0
[Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NnbtP8w3GX-GcGULysWSbU4jnxgUk0piskP12fAMbic/edit?usp=sharing), this will be updated as the project progresses.  

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Unity 2021.3.11f1

## 🚀 Getting Started
I recommend you clone the project to try it, but you can just download the Assets/HolyAudio2D/ directory and place it in your own project.  
The project contains a very basic scene to showcase the functionality.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:holypeachy/HolyAudio2D.git
```
Run using Unity 2021

## 📤 Output Example:
Since it's audio I can't really show it here, so here is a picture of the first page of the docs :D

#### Ignore this, it's for future reference. Just in case.
### Recent Work: 
- Added function to change looping of sounds
- Added methods to get length of clips.
- Editted docs for 0.1.0

### To Do: 
- Do more testing in a real project.
- Prep a package for release.

### Future Ideas:
- Add the ability to modify start and end times for the clip.
- Add a method that randomly plays a sound out of multiple sounds.
- Add "sound occlusion" and reverb.
